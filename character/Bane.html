              <div class="title">Story</div>
              <div class="story-details">
                    <p>The excellent jewelry and leather products of the people of the Northern Vale not only gave rise to their booming maritime trade economy, but also brought about many illegal dealings, such as with the notorious pirates of the Northern Vale. For a long time, the pirates of the Frozen Seas and other sea regions existed as bands. They divided territories between themselves, and held to a principle of non-interference, plundering only merchant ships that passed through their own territories, to enrich themselves. This became the de facto rule of the Pirate community.</p>
                    <p>This widely respected order lasted until the arrival of Bane and his men. Cruel, cunning, violent, and tyrannical… No list of adjectives commonly given to pirates would be enough to describe Bane's terrible reputation. Born into a family of pirates, Bane was raised and trained in the strictest manner from childhood. By the time he became an adult, Bane was already the most feared pirate of his time.</p>
                    <p>But young Bane's ambition was far greater than this. Not long after, Bane murdered his uncle, and assumed control of the Behemoth, a seaborne fortress with an enormous battering ram and dozens of cannons, hence truly becoming Captain Bane. He then broke the ancient rule of the pirates, and started to encroach upon other pirates' territories.</p>
                    <p>Facing Bane's incredible firepower and terrible cruelty, the other pirates had only two options: submit, or be annihilated. More and more fugitives and opportunists gathered under Bane's flag, earning him enough funds to establish a huge Pirate fleet, which came to be known as the Black Sharks. For many years, Bane dominated all of the Frozen Seas's sea routes, literally ruling the people of Northern Vale's coast with an iron fist, and the ever-victorious sea dweller, named himself Lord of the Seven Seas. Some people within Northern Vale who could no longer bear Bane's despotic rule armed themselves and gathered under the banner of his nemesis Franco, to wage a war of resistance against Bane.</p>
                    <p>At the age of eighteen, Alucard finally completed all of his studies and formal preparations. Encouraged by Tigreal, he became the monastery's Arbiter of Light. He was ordered to go forth and eliminate the demons and heretics hidden throughout the world, and so he picked up his father's old sword, given to him by Tigreal, and set off. In his father's name, and fueled by his deep hatred of demons, Alucard soon became the greatest demon hunter in the world.</p>
                    <p>An unforeseen incident occurred during a demon hunting operation on the border of the Barren Lands. Alucard was injured by a magic blade, sustaining a wound that could not be healed. Darkness poured into his body from the wound, and his arm began to undergo a strange transformation... In order to prevent the mutation from spreading throughout his whole body, Alucard asked an old smith to help him forge a pair of gauntlets. This was no ordinary smith — he was a survivor of that fated battle, a member of the Light's Order who covered his allies' retreat along with Alucard's father.</p>
                    <p>He recognized the huge sword in Alucard's hand. After learning who he was, the old man told Alucard that the reason the second regiment was forced so deep into enemy territory was that the high-level knights at that time were greedy for glory and too impulsive, which led to the second regiment finding itself trapped in a tight encirclement. In a moment of desperation, Alucard's father led some soldiers to cover the retreat of the main force headed by Tigreal, and was then swarmed by a tide of demons and disappeared. He was the only survivor, rescued by Alucard's father.</p>
                    <p>After learning the truth, Alucard returned to the capital and questioned Tigreal about the battle and why he hadn't told him what had really happened that day. Seeing the anger gripping Alucard, Tigreal confessed the guilt he felt for abandoning his allies and the silence he was forced to maintain at the behest of his family. He expressed his willingness to make up for it in any way he could, claiming that he would give his own life if he had to. However, before Tigreal, who was once like a brother to him, the young Alucard was entangled in a web of confusion. He couldn't bear to kill Tigreal, but he couldn't forgive him either.</p>
                    <p>For the sake of his father's honor, Alucard asked the Empire to reveal the truth of the second regiment and restore his father's name. However, the knights of that battle had become some of the most powerful figures in the Empire. They refused Alucard's request and drove him out of the capital. On top of this, the puritanical Monastery of Light was strongly against Alucard's unnatural right hand, repeatedly making trouble for him and even calling him a heretic. For the longest time, Alucard's deep hatred of the demons and his desire to regain his father's honor had spurred him on in his mission to serve as the Arbiter of Light. But now, faced with the Empire that had betrayed his father, and a church that treated him with scorn, Alucard made an unthinkable decision: To betray the Monastery of Light and fight for himself.</p>
                    <p>In the following years, Alucard began wandering the Land of Dawn, annihilating demons everywhere he went on his own terms and searching for clues as to his father's whereabouts. His demonic right hand not only brought him great strength, but also became an unstable element which he was forced to hide under his heavy armor every day.</p>
                    <p>After a string of epic battles, Alucard became known as one of the most legendary fighters in Moniyan. Soon, everyone knew that wherever demons ran rampant, the demon hunter with the dark right hand would no doubt descend from the sky and leave none alive.</p>
