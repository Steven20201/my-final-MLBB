Joyful and outgoing since youth, She loves adventures and can unintentionally be mischievous at times, often causing trouble. But she has a great dream of one day becoming a powerful Leonin Mage.

During their journey, they ran into many different opponents and Nana would always assist Miya, Finishing enemies off with her Boomerang at the crucial moment.

As a prankster, Nana still liked to play tricks on people during battle, especially by toying with her opponent with the Molina Smooch. What makes her happiest is to see those who underestimated and mocked her, Turn into a cute little rabbit. This became one of her main ways to harass her opponents, before defeating them.</p>

              <div class="title">Story</div>
              <div class="story-details">
                    <p>After the Endless War, the Land of Dawn was covered scars, but the Moonlit Forest of Azrya was still bathed in the light of the Moon Goddess. I addition to the elves, there were various other strange creatures living in this dense forest with a most unrestrained bearing. There were very few disputes.</p>
                    <p>Leonins were the most peculiar race in this forest. They were few in number, but they were born with a cute appearance, agile demeanor, and some talent for using spiritual power. They used their spiritual power to bake apple pies, catch fish, and jump around in the woods… So long as the Leonins were awake, the Moonlit Forest was especially lively.</p>
                    <p>Nana was the most naughty Leonin among them. She was born on a moonlit night with great spiritual powers. Nana was naturally enthusiastic and energetic, and liked to use her own power to help her friends in the jungle. It is just a pity that she, being rash and reckless, either baked other people's apple pies to ashes or uprooted the berry bushes. Gradually, everyone began to distance themselves from Nana.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, there was a little leopard cat called Molina who was always by Nana's side. Molina was a small leopard cat living on the edge of the Moonlit Forest. She had no father, no mother, and no friends. She lived alone ever since she could remember. Owing to an accident, Molina broke into the gathering place of the Leonins, got stuck in a dangerous cave and it was Nana who saved her. Since then, Molina always liked to pester Nana. But Nana didn't like being with Molina all day long. She felt that Molina, who only had ability to change, was too weak and given that Nana always like to make trouble, felt like Molina shouldn't always be by her side.</p>
                    <p>Nana preferred to play with her fellow Leonins.</p>
                    <p>Although she felt disappointed because of everyone's rejection, Nana, who was naturally optimistic, would soon try to help everyone. One time, the indolent Leonins had a rare get-together and held a discussion about building a playground that would belong to the Leonin race. For the Leonins, this was a rare, serious event, and Nana also enthusiastically participated in it.</p>
                    <p>After months of hard work, with the efforts of all the Leonins, they used moonlight stones gifted by the elves, long logs gifted by the forest, colorful stucco paint mixed evenly with berry juice, and other treasures gifted by the spirits of nature to build the exquisite Meow Playground. It had a cat climbing frame, fish catching pond, dessert room, big trampoline…everything. On the day it was built, to celebrate, the Leonins took out some old and dusty fruit wine, baked hundreds of apple pies and grilled sea bass, and drank in the garden of Meow Playground.</p>
                    <p>Nana liked this kind of event the most. She jumped around happily, picking up the fruit wine and slurping it. She drank so happily. When the moonlight came, the drunken Nana jumped on to the stage. She wanted to use her spiritual power to bake more apple pie for everyone to celebrate. But when she started to cast her spell, the power in her hands began to lose control, and a hurricane set off, blowing the Meow Playground into such disarray that it completely lost its original appearance.</p>
                    <p>Seeing that the whole race's efforts were ruined by her own mistake, Nana felt guilty and frightened. Before everyone woke up, she quietly left her fellow Leonins without taking anything with her, wanting to find a way to control her power so that she could come back and help everyone build a more fun paradise.</p>
                    <p>Nana walked all the way to the west, her path filled with strange creatures. She tried to talk to some little creatures, but everyone ignored her, causing Nana to feel extremely depressed. Nana, who had never walked out of the Moonlit Forest, felt an unprecedented sense of loss and loneliness, until she found out that Molina had been following her secretly from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Molina understood Nana's guilt and how she mut be feeling. She told Nana: In the southern part of Azrya - the Shadow Swamp near the Land of Despair, there is a kind of mystical fruit that grows in dangerous places that can help the user to control their own energy.</p>
                    <p>Nana was a little surprised that the little leopard cat was still following her, and she was a little moved. But Nana still refused Molina's request to go with her to the Shadow Swamp. She was worried that there would be some dangers on the way that would hurt her little friend. Nana pretended to frighten Molina harshly: “You're so weak and small. Don't follow me.”</p>
                    <p>But shortly after she left, Molina caught up and stubbornly refused to leave.</p>
                    <p>Nana discovered for the first time that the weak and small leopard cat was also persistent. She was happy inside, but on the surface she accepted Molina's company with reluctance.</p>
                    <p>The two passed through numerous obstacles and finally reached the Shadow Swamp. In the depths of the cave, they found the magical fruit they'd been looking for. Nana happily went to get the fruit, but did not notice the gradually approaching danger. Near the Land of Despair, there lived many monsters corroded by the Abyss, the pure nature of Nana made this pitch black and ugly creature lick its chops and open its fiercely-looking mouth.</p>
                    <p>Molina by her side noticed the danger. Seeing her good friend Nana was about to pick the fruit, she yelled and put to use the power of transformation that would only work from time to time - Molina became Nana's likeness and stood in front of the defenseless Nana.</p>
                    <p>“As weak as I am, I can still protect my friend.”</p>
                    <p>Nana, who had gotten the fruit, was stunned by everything that had happened in front of her. With the help of the fruit, Nana sent a powerful force to repel the monster, but Molina was also dying. Nana cried and shared her spiritual power with Molina, but it was no use. Finally, Molina grabbed Nana's hand and shared her transformation power with Nana, hoping that she would be with her only friend forever.</p>
                    <p>“Stay happy, stay happy forever.”</p>
                    <p>In turned out that learning control was only the beginning of her growth. Nana continued on the road with Molina's blessing and entrustment.</p>
                    <p>Those who have never forgotten will always survive in another way; those who have never forgotten their hometown will always return to their hometown.</p>

                           <p>Due to the mechanic of her passive, Miya tend to buy attack speed item after two attack damage items first, much more effective.</p>
                           <p>The player may want to keep attacking to keep the passive active most of the time, this ability have lasting 4 seconds.</p>
                            <p>Her 1st skill is extremely powerful late game, especially with items. This ability shines and able to attack 3 targets for clearing the lane or attacking more heroes to clash.</p>
                            <p>Her  2nd skill, Arrow of eclipse is good zoning, crowd control ability, pretty good for a marksman, helps you flee or chase an enemy hero.</p>
                            <p>  For most powerful ultimate for a marksman at all time, use this ability wisely. Using for escape and increasing damage.</p>
