Joyful and outgoing since youth, She loves adventures and can unintentionally be mischievous at times, often causing trouble. But she has a great dream of one day becoming a powerful Leonin Mage.

As a prankster, Nana still liked to play tricks on people during battle, especially by toying with her opponent with the Dance of Death. What makes her happiest is to see those who underestimated and mocked her, Turn into a cute little rabbit. This became one of her main ways to harass her opponents, before defeating them.</p>

                            <p>Nana may have been mischievious and cutesy, but that was not how Miya saw her. A serious Nana could be quite terrifying, as Miya vaguely remembered an outraged Nana almost destroying half of the Enchanted forest. It would be best not to anger her in battle or else she can most probably, use her most powerful ability 'Shadow Assault' to let opponent, know the meaning of shock and awe.</p>

                    <p>Karina could barely stop herself from shaking as she stared at <a href="#">Selena</a> before her, a woman now almost unrecognizable. Rage, regret, desperationâ€¦ A thousand different emotions flooded within her. Yet she knew that what mattered is that, right now, her little sister was standing against her like this. She'd never even imagined this could happen.</p>
                    <p>Karina had once staunchly believed herself capable of protecting her sister, Selena. They had always been inseparable, depending on each other for as long as she could remember: elegant and mild young Elves that bounded throughout the lush forests. Yet with the spread of the Abyss' corruption, the Shadow Swamp they called home was tainted and fell to its evil; all Elves who remained were similarly corrupted as they became Dark Elves in servitude of the Abyss.</p>
                    <p>Dark Elves are of special significance to the demons, owning to the fact that they retain their ancient Elven powers despite having been forced into submission by the Abyss. The Lord of the Abyss seeks them out with great avarice, determined to use the Dark Elves as the stepping stones that pave his way to devour this world whole. From this, nobody can escape.</p>
                    <p>Karina Was trained to become a cold-hearted assassin from a very young age. As such she has no qualms in using all means necessary to achieve her goals, unfazed even if her target is a woman or a child.</p>
                    <p>But Karina, this coldblooded killer, always treated her Selena with the greatest warmth and love.</p>
                    <p>In order to keep Selena safe, Karina requested of their clan's leader that she be kept in the dark abut her profession so as to never get involved in the slaughter and killing. While Selena knew nothing of her older sister's affairs, Karina considered her the only comfort in her life otherwise full of murder and violence. Selena was a symbol to her that she could always return home, to be with her sister.</p>
                    <p>Karina knew very well that, were they to descend into the battles of light versus darkness in the Endless War, chaos could be right around the corner. Their lives would be hanging by a thread. She was left by no choice, but at least she could still protect her little sister.</p>
                    <p>Under Karina's protection, Selena was distanced from all the killing and conspiracy. What Karina could never have expected, however, was for the barriers she'd erected around her sister to steadily erode as she grew older. And the reason that her defenses were failing came not from the outside world, but from Karina herself.</p>
                    <p>As Selena grew older, she became attuned to the fact that something was not quite right about her sister. Sometimes Karina would leave home suddenly, not to return for a long time - and when she did, more often than not she'd be injured form head to toe. Selena, never knew how her sister would gain such wounds, and it plagued her with a deep uneasiness.</p>
                    <p>This time, Karina had returned home battered and beaten once more. Even in the face of her anxious sister, she wouldn't speak a word on it. Not long after her wounds had healed, Karina was already making preparations to leave again, but now Selena stood in her way. She didn't know what it was her sister was heading out to do, but Selena knew that if she let her go again, she could lose her beloved sister forever.</p>
                    <p>Karina disregarded her left anyway, however. She knew that this was a burden she must bear alone. Watching as her sister disappeared into the distance, Selena swore to herself: no more would she just wait at home like a naive child.</p>
                    <p>Selena cautiously tailed Karina, who soon caught on that she was being followed sought to shake her off her trail. Yet as they left the Shadow Swamp, Selena was suddenly attacked by a dark figure; Karina had to make a move and save her sister from her predicament.</p>
                    <p>It was the first time Selena had ever seen her older sister in battle. Watching as Karina crushed the enemy, Selena felt relieved but also came to a realization: she and her sister lived in two very different worlds. Worlds that were far, far apart.</p>
                    <p>Selena sought to become powerful, and so went to looking for their clan's leader. This was to be the start of Karina's nightmare. The leader had long ago fallen into the clutches of the Abyss' corruption, and instead of giving Selena guidance, he led her to be a sacrifice to the Abyss, setting the young girl hungry for power on a tragic path.</p>
                    <p>By the Karina had rushed over, Selena had changed beyond all recognition. The young girl was suspended loft, a thick malice pervading the air all around.</p>
                    <p>Selena's naivety had led her to sacrifice herself to the Abyss. The Lord of the Abyss stole away all her sense of self, warped her wishes to protect Karina, and transformed her into a tool of world destruction.</p>
                    <p>Selena could no longer hear the desperate cries of her sister, Karina had no choice but to cross swords with her, to return her sister snatched by the Abyss. Never had Karina imagined that the combat skills she'd slaved to perfect would have to be used against her younger sister, nor that Selena would unleash such an explosive power against her sister.</p>
                    <p>Karina failed. Facing defeat at the hands of the sister so familiar, yet now so strange to her, she was left with no choice but to leave as hear heart panged with regret.</p>
                    <p>With that, Karina left the Shadow Swamp to roam the Land of Despair. She was reborn from darkness, laying full fury of her vengeance upon the Abyss and demons that had taken her dear sister. She swore that she would make them pay.</p>
                    <p>All the while, she held on to that belief: that, one day, she would finally be able to take Selena home again.</p>
